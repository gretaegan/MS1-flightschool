# Flight School

link to the live site can be found here (add link here)

My project is a website for a flight school that trains people to become commercial airline pilots. I chose this idea based on my own experiences as a pilot, and due to 
a huge worldwide demand for pilots.

## UX
**User Stories**
As a user of this website I want :
1. A website that looks professional and functions.
1. A clear explaination of what kind of training is provided by the school.
1. Images that are relevant to the website and provide visual experience.
1. Testamonials from previous students about the school.
1. To be able to contact the school easily .

### Design

**Typography** 
I used the font family 'Poppins' throught the site as I felt like it provided a clean, professional feel. 
I used uppercase text for each of my headings with letter spacing.

**Color Scheme** 
I used a palate of blues - specificially navy and a teal color to convay professionalism. I also felt like this matched the color scheme of the image of the 
aircraft  EI-FII that I used in the training section. (add in hexidecimal codes here on next commit).

**Images Used**
All images used in this project are my own pictures that I took throughout my time in Flight school. The pictures were specifically chosen as I wanted 
to show a range of different aircraft that the school would offer. They are a Boeing 737-800, a Salisbury Firefly and a Cessna 172RG.
The hero image was chosen because aspiring pilots will see the image of cadets flying a jet and it will provide inspiration that it could be them if they go
through the training.

**Overall Feel**
Overall I wanted a professional and clean feel to the website. It was important that it looked simple and clear to the user.
