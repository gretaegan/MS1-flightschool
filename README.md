# Flight School

My project is a website for a flight school that trains people to become commercial airline pilots. I chose this idea based on my own experience of becoming a commercial
pilot and my knowledge of aviation. 
 In 2019 there was a huge worldwide demand for commercial pilots and while the pandemic has paused this, it is expected that when aviation recovers the demand will be even
 greater. Pilots will need to be trained and flight schools will become valuable once again.
 This flight school provides the Integrated style of training, which is favored by most airlines around the world.

# UX
## User Stories 

As a user of this website, I want
1. To understand the brand at a first glance.
1. To understand what the product being sold is.
1. To see information about the training provided clearly and without having to go searching for it.
1. To understand the entry requirements and any barriers that may prevent me from applying to the course.
1. To be able to contact the school easily.

# Design

### Images Used
All images used in this project are my own pictures that I took throughout my time in Flight school. The pictures were specifically chosen as I wanted 
to show a range of different aircraft that the school would offer. They are a Boeing 737-800, a Salisbury Firefly and a Cessna 172RG.
The hero image was chosen because aspiring pilots will see the image of cadets flying a jet and it will provide inspiration that it could be them if they go
through the training.

### Typography
* 'Poppins' is the font used for this website, with sans-serif as the fall back. It is a clean and simple font that gives a sense of professionalism and
readability.
* All headings are in Uppercase with letter spacing to make them stand out and grab attention. 
I used a custom horizontal rule under the headings to add attention
and draw the eye.

### Layout
The website is a simple, single scrolling page design that contains links to the different sections of the page.
My intention was to keep the website as simple and clear as possible. 
I used to Bootstrap grid system to provide the layout of the website and to ensure responsiveness.
The navigation bar at the top of the page is fixed and, on smaller screen sizes, becomes a data toggler button to prevent cluttering the screen. 

### Colors 
I kept to a cool palatte of blues: a dark navy (#071337) and a teal(00cccc).
My hero-text was kept to a simple off-white color(#fafafa) so that it was still readable and grabbed attention, without distracting from the hero image of the 
two pilots flying the Boeing737-800. 


### Overall Feel
The most important thing was that the website conveyed professionalism as it is what you would want and expect from a company that trains pilots.
I am satisfied that this has been achieved with the color scheme, layout of the website and images I have chosen to use.

# Wireframes

will add these later.

# Features
Flight School is a mobile first design that is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes.
The Navigation bar list items become hidden in a data-toggler on smaller screen sizes.
The social media icons link to their respective websites.
The logo in the Navbar is a link back to the beginning of the page.
The 'Contact Us' button links the user to the contact form section.

## Future Features
Currently, the form system does not function. However once I have learned Javascript this can be made fully functional.
